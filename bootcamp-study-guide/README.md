# Emilio's Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was created to facilitate the creation of notes and organize them for the work done during the prework course of the coding bootcamp. 
It was created for the purpose of having a dedicated space to practice and review the core habilities of HTML, CSS, Git and Java Script.
The study guide seeks to solve the problem of not having a digital space to store basic notes in an organized way for the coding bootcamp.
Finally, I learned the base, technical and practical, habilities that an aspiring developer should have. Starting from what means to have and practice a developer's mentality daily, all the way to the first basic elements and program created with a variety of coding languages.
